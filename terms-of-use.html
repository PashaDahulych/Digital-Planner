					<h1>Digital Planner > Terms of Use</h1>
					<p>
						By downloading or using the app, these terms will
						automatically apply to you – you should make sure
						therefore that you read them carefully before using
						the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the
						app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any
						way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
						source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
						to translate the app into other languages or make
						derivative versions. The app itself, and all the
						trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other
						intellectual property rights related to it, still
						belong to Alina Shpak. Alina Shpak is committed to
						ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
						possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to
						make changes to the app or to charge for its
						services, at any time and for any reason. We will
						never charge you for the app or its services without
						making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
						paying for.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Digital Planner app stores and processes
						personal data that you have provided to us, to
						provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep
						your phone and access to the app secure. We
						therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or
						root your phone, which is the process of removing
						software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
						official operating system of your device. It could
						make your phone vulnerable to
						malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
						phone’s security features and it could mean that the
						Digital Planner app won’t work properly or at all.
						The app does use third-party services that declare
						their Terms and Conditions.

					</ul>
					<p>
						You should be aware that there are certain things
						that Alina Shpak will not take responsibility for.
						Certain functions of the app will require the app to
						have an active internet connection. The connection
						can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
						provider, but Alina Shpak cannot take responsibility
						for the app not working at full functionality if you
						don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
						of your data allowance left.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you’re using the app outside of an area with
						Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
						agreement with your mobile network provider will
						still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
						mobile provider for the cost of data for the
						duration of the connection while accessing the app,
						or other third-party charges. In using the app,
						you’re accepting responsibility for any such
						charges, including roaming data charges if you use
						the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region
						or country) without turning off data roaming. If you
						are not the bill payer for the device on which
						you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume
						that you have received permission from the bill
						payer for using the app.
					</p>
					<p>
						Along the same lines, Alina Shpak cannot always take
						responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
						need to make sure that your device stays charged –
						if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on
						to avail the Service, Alina Shpak cannot accept
						responsibility.
					</p>
					<p>
						With respect to Alina Shpak’s responsibility for
						your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
						important to bear in mind that although we endeavor
						to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
						times, we do rely on third parties to provide
						information to us so that we can make it available
						to you. Alina Shpak accepts no liability for any
						loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result
						of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
					</p>
					<p>
						At some point, we may wish to update the app. The
						app is currently available on iOS – the requirements
						for the system(and for any additional systems we
						decide to extend the availability of the app to) may
						change, and you’ll need to download the updates if
						you want to keep using the app. Alina Shpak does not
						promise that it will always update the app so that
						it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS
						version that you have installed on your device.
						However, you promise to always accept updates to the
						application when offered to you, We may also wish to
						stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it
						at any time without giving notice of termination to
						you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
						termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
						you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using
						the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
