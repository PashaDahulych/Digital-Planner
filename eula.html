					<p>
						This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal

						you do not agree with the terms and conditions of
						this EULA agreement, do not install or use the
						Software, and you must not accept this EULA
						agreement.
					</p>
					<p>
						This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software
						supplied by Alina Shpak herewith regardless of
						whether other software is referred to or described
						herein. The terms also apply to any Alina Shpak
						updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and
						support services for the Software, unless other
						terms accompany those items on delivery. If so,
						those terms apply.
